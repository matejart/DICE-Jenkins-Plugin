Notes on Jenkins plug-ins
=========================

## Getting started

Learning to develop Jenkins plug-ins is not entirely trivial, because the
plethora of information that is out there tends to be more confusing to the
novices than helpful. But here are a few of our own notes to hopefully speed
the process up.

* The [Extend Jenkins] Wiki page is a central page with all the needed (and
  sometimes unneeded) documents.
* The first visit is the [getting started][Plugin tutorial 1] page, slightly
  misleadingly named "Plugin tutorial". This gives instructions on how to start
  a plug-in from the scratch. The Hello World plugin created by the
  `hpi:create` maven target is already a nice working plug-in. It provides
  a descriptor for configuration of the job-specific settings, and the
  call-back `perform`, which does something when Jenkins invokes the job.
* Then see the [What next] page. It provides a few use cases, the most suitable
  extension points, and in some cases a plugin sample.
* Find inspiraiton and directions from other people's plug-ins such as an
  [AppDynamics plug-in][AppDynamics git repo], which also has a
  [tutorial blog post][AppDynamics tutorial].

### Adding a configuration form

We usually want to give the users ability to configure some parameters in the
build step or post-build step settings of a job. Extend a class from one of the
extension points (e.g., from [What next]), such as `Recorder` for post-build
steps. The class needs to override a `public DescriptorImpl getDescriptor()`
method, which returns a `public static final class` that is decorated as
`@Extension`. This last bit is very important.

In the `resources` sub-folder that mirrors the class's fully qualified name,
create a `config.jelly` script to implement the view of the configuration.

To provide a global configuration of the plug-in, also create a `global.jelly`
script.

### Adding a build report

The goal is to have a link in the navigation sidebar (on the left) of the
build's result that will take the user to a custom view of that build.

* Implement a class that implements the `hudson.model.Action` interface. Or
  any of its subinterfaces, or extend an implementing class.
* The `getUrlName` implementation must return a unique subpath. Do not include
  trailing slashes in the UrlName (e.g., use `"dice-report"` instead of
  `"dice-report/"`).
* The link will only appear in the list if the Action was used in the build.
  So to test the view of a newly added action, first trigger a build that will
  store the Action in its `build.xml`.

**Note**: if you **don't** want that an Action in the job to produce a build
report page, then use the `hudson.model.InvisibleAction` class when extending
the Action implementation. 

* To defer implementation of the report to a different class, use a
  `WeakReference` in the `Action` implementation class, and also have this
  class implement `StaplerProxy` to provide the `getTarget()` implementation.
* The side panel appears to the left of the report and contains standard
  Jenkins navigation links. We do not explicitly provide the `sidepanel.jelly`
  but rely on the built-in script. However, the script needs an instance
  of an `AbstractBuild<?. ?>` class (it also works if you cast a
  `hudson.model.Run` instance into `AbstractBuild<?. ?>`). So make sure you
  store it with the `Action` as received in the `perform` method.
* Implement an `AbstractBuild<?, ?> getBuild()` method in the report's
  implementation class.
* Use the `st:include` to include the `sidepanel.jelly`:

<pre>
&lt;j:jelly xmlns:j="jelly:core" xmlns:st="jelly:stapler"
         xmlns:l="/lib/layout"&gt;
  &lt;l:layout norefresh="true"&gt;
    <b>&lt;st:include it="${it.build}" page="sidepanel.jelly"/&gt;</b>
    &lt;l:main-panel&gt;
</pre>

* If Jenkins complains from hell with "No page found 'sidepanel.jelly'", then
  the `it` parameter is probably `null`.

## Notes on using Eclipse

The [getting started][Plugin tutorial 1] document provides a working solution
for converting a maven-based project into one that Eclipse will open. But here
is the problem that appears pretty quickly:

* **ClassName cannot be resolved to a type** with `ClassName` being a valid
  class in the project
* **Only a type can be imported. package.name.ClassName resolves to a package**
  but we do not specify any package named after a class.

The problem is that, by default, Eclipse treats the resources folder as a
source folder. Since that mirrors the folder hierarchy of existing classes
including the parent package path, it thinks that there is also a package named
the same. What helps is to remove the resources from the build path:

* In the Package explorer, right-click on the `src/main/resources` node.
* Select **Build Path** -> **Remove from Build Path**
